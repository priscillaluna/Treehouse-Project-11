# Treehouse Project 11
I was given a poorly optimized site and reduced the total load size to under 1.3mb and total requests to less than 27. I analyzed the assets I had been provided to see where optimizations needed to be made, made those optimizations, and measured their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles were required.
